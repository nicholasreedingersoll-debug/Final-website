    <p class="scream">Pre Nevermind Nirvana wasn't the hit band as it's remebered as. The start of Nirvana wasn't immediate success, the band started in the bassist Krist Novoeselic's mother's house (1988). In 1989 they recorded "Bleach" for a grand total $606.17 with 8 tracks, they slowly worked up and they pitched new songs until 1991 when they released their hit album "Nevermind".</p>
